* AlphaConnect

AlphaConnect is a deep RL system based on AlphaZero.

The network architecture and hyperparameters I trained with here were sufficient to achieve gradual continuous learning but I did not test many other configurations.

The heart of the algorithm (self-play training data generation) is in =mcts.py= and should be easily extendable to other projects and implementations of adversial 2-player games. 

See [[https://ajpkim.com/projects/alphaconnect][my site]] for a detailed project writeup.
